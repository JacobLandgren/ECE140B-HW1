    <h1>Product Information Architecture
    </h1>

    <h2>Part 1: </h2>
    <div class="box">
        <ol>
            <li>What basic information does a typical user need to have access to on 
                first interaction with your product?
                <div class="subdiv">
                    Need to be directed to the website to set up their account, and need instructions
                    on how to link their barcode scanner to their account.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>What IA Design Principles (Dan Brown) are important for your product?
                <div class="subdiv">
                    Principle of Choice: The user only needs to to interact with their account 
                    preferences and the barcode scanner, all other tasks are done for them to make
                    the process convenient for the customer.
                </div>
                <div class="subdiv">
                    Principle of Front Doors: Since the website is primarily for account preferences,
                    a random person navigating to any part of the website won't be discouraged as the
                    site is simple and will instruct the user to order the barcode scanner to continue.
                </div>
                <div class="subdiv">
                    Principle of Growth: The system can easily grow with increased users as the bulk of
                    the product boils down to a database interacting with a delivery API. This type of 
                    system is dynamic to growth.
                </div>
                <li>Which structural Organizational Principle(s) make(s) the most the sense for your product?
                    <div class="subdiv">
                        Topical: Seeing as a bulk of the website is to configure account preferences and 
                        information, this will all be under the account settings page for the user.
                    </div>
                    <div class="subdiv">
                        Chronological: The website will also display previous orders and the current cart in 
                        the order that they occured.
                    </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Part 2: </h2>
    <div class="box">
        <ol>
            <li>
                #4: Fonts Organize Design
                <div class="subdiv">
                    Another way the user will easily differentiate between the previous orders and the 
                    current cart is through fonts. These subsections on the homepage will be headed by a 
                    large title corresponding to the section, which will allow the user to quickly identify
                    what data they are looking at.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                #6: Proximity Suggests Relationships
                <div class="subdiv">
                    The data corresponding to the previous orders will be grouped together, while the data
                    corresponding to the current cart will be grouped together. This will futher differentiate and
                    classify the two sets of data for the user to quickly identify.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                #8: Alignment Directs Eyes
                <div class="subdiv">
                    For the homepage, the current cart and previous orders will be front and center,
                    while the account settings will be at the top and off to the side. This will dictate
                    where the user's eyes will natural navigate to make browsing efficient.
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
