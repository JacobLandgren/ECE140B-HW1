    <h1>Examples for "Laws of UI Design"</h1>

    <h2>Hick's Law: Cadence Virtuoso</h2>
    <div>
        <img src="virtuoso.png">
    </div>
    <div>
        Cadence Virtuoso is notorious for its complicated and cluttered UI. Virtuoso is a application
        for IC chip design and simulation, and seeing as there are so many variables in that space, 
        the software must have a lot of functionality and variables, which however leads to a cluttered and
        confusing UI. This is an example for Hick's Law as the time it takes to find the button you need is 
        increased due to the number of options on the screen.

    <h2>Jacob's Law: Google Docs/Slides/Sheets/etc.</h2>

    <div>
        No matter what Google Suite product you are using, the UI is (for the most part) exactly 
        the same. They have all of the typical "File, Edit, View,..." tabs at the very top, followed
        by the buttons to edit the document. They all have the share button at the top right and the 
        button to go back to the homepage on the top left, with many of the options being shared between
        all of the different products. This is an example of Jacob's Law as Google has their UI consistent
        across all their Suite products to allow the user to quickly adapt to a new product if they ever 
        used any other Google Suite product.

    <h2>Law of Proximity: Spotify</h2>
    <div>
        <img src="spotify.PNG">
    </div>
    <div>
        The UI for Spotify has very traditional design, with a sidebar on the left, a page in the center, 
        and a media interface on the bottom. However, Spotify goes above and beyond with with this design 
        through the use of shading. The entire application's color is in different shades of gray, where the
        different shades separate the content on the page, allowing the user to easily differentiate between
        the different sections. The page in the center also uses boxes to group things together to further this.
        This is a use of the Law of Proximity as it groups things together to allow for users to understand and 
        organize information.
