    <h2>Top 5 Features
    </h2>

    <div class="box">
        <ol>
            <li>
                Automated ordering by barcode scanning
                <div>
                    This is the main feature for the product. This offers the main benefit of
                    automated grocery ordering and delivery for the user, which is for all users.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Customizable delivery time
                <div>
                    This is the feature for specifying the time, both day and time, that you want
                    orders to be delivered. This allows greater flexibility for our product to 
                    people's existing grocery routines, and is applicable for users who want a 
                    consistent delivery service.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Customizable ordering time
                <div>
                    This feature on the other hand is to specify when you want the our system to
                    make the order based on the current cart. This allows people to make as many
                    orders as they want when they want, which is good for users who may want to 
                    make less total orders with more items to not pay as much in delivery.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Easy pairing process
                <div>
                    Another big feature is the simple and easy pairing process to pair the barcode
                    scanner with the user's account. This is important for users who may not be very
                    tech savy and would benefit from a straight forward and simple process.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Customizable Personal Information
                <div>
                    A feature which may not appear as a "feature" since it is so obvious is the 
                    configurable personal information. This allows the system to dynamically adapt
                    to the user's address, find local grocery stores, know whether the user is 21 or
                    older for alcohol, and let the user pick the payment method. These features are 
                    useful and necessary for all users.
                </div>

    <h2>Product Interactions
    </h2>

    <div class="box">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Barcode Scanner
                <div>
                    The product interaction that the user has with our system that is physical is the
                    hardware of the barcode scanner RPI hardware system. For the user, this will be a
                    barcode scanner, which for most will be intuitive from prior experience with barcode
                    scanners, either directly or through observation of others using them, and the pairing 
                    button. Both of these are straight-forward and give the user the satisfying act of 
                    physically adding an item to their cart.  
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Login Page
                <div>
                    Now onto the website, where the first interaction will be the login page. This 
                    is where the user will either log into their account or create a new account. 
                    The process will be very similar to other sites and those who have experience with
                    logging into or making an account for a website will not need any assistance, and if not
                    there will be instructions.  
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                User Settings Page
                <div>
                    After logging in, the user needs to set up their account prior to making any orders. 
                    This includes the user's address, card info, birthday, email, etc. This will have the
                    interface of a typical web form. After a user has set up their account, they can always
                    return to this page to view or edit it.  
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Pairing Page
                <div>
                    As the second half of the pairing process with the physical button attached to the 
                    barcode scanner, the pairing page will have a digital button the user presses to pair 
                    the user's barcode scanner with their account. The interaction will be basically exactly
                    the same as pressing the physical button for the user, which is should be easily identified
                    by the user.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Home Page/Cart
                <div>
                    Lastly, the user will also be able to interact with their cart, where they can view and edit
                    it. This interaction will be very similar to other digital cart interfaces like Amazon, and 
                    the interface will also be fairly self-explanatory and easy for the user to use.
                </div>
