    <h2>Project Synopsis</h2>

    <div>
      The idea for our MVP project revolves around the logging and upkeep of grocery items in a residense's 
      kitchen/pantry. We emphasize residenses with multiple independent grocery shoppers sharing one storage space
      (ie. an apartment with roommates or a rented house with tenents) as the inhabitants in these residenses often
      lose track of their grocery's expiration dates, number of items they have, and whose item is whose.
    </div>
    <div>
      We will acheive this through the use of a web app which the residenses will have accounts on. This app 
      will display the residense's items, their expiration dates, and quantity. The logging for this will be done
      either manually or through the use of scanning the exisiting barcodes on the grocery items. If the residense has multiple
      occupants, they can share the same household within the app and can differentiate the owners of specific items. For when
      items run out and are disposed, again this can be logged either manually through the app or through the use of RFID chips 
      attached to the product which will "chirp" when the item is put into the garbage receptical.
