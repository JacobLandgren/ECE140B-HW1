            <li>From Inventory Tracker to Restocker
                <div>
                    The original concept for the product was a kitchen
                    inventory tracker, which will know the inventory through
                    the user scanning each item before storing it and before 
                    throwing it away. This was going to be achieved through either
                    barcodes or RFID tags, but it was scrapped early on in the
                    process due to complexity, barrier of entry, and the wasteful throwing
                    away of RFID tags if they were used.

                <div>
                    <h2>The Zoom-in Pivot</h2>
                    The Zoom-in Pivot applies to this pivot as the automated 
                    restocking was a possible feature of our initial inventory
                    tracker, where when the product is thrown away, the user can 
                    opt in to it being automatically reordered.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>From RFID Tags to Barcodes
                <div>
                    After we narrowed down the product to just being used 
                    to automate the reordering of groceries, we had the option
                    of either using a barcode, which the user would have to scan
                    before throwing away the item, or an RFID tag that the user
                    would have to attach to the item when they first buy and store
                    it, which will then be sensed by a reader attached to the trashcan
                    when it is thrown away. The RFID tag allowed the user to not have to
                    worry about scanning the item manually when throwing it away, however, 
                    they had to attach and configure the tag initially, and then tag would get
                    thrown away with the item, which is wasteful. Because of this, we opted to
                    just use the item's barcode and have the user scan it before throwing it 
                    away.

                    <h2>The Technology Pivot</h2>
                    The technology pivot can be applied to this pivot, as 
                    we decided to go away from RFID to a barcode scanner. Although
                    RFID is a more modern and cutting edge technology, it is not 
                    as applicable to this product and although it would be cool to 
                    play around with RFID tags, it is not the appropriate choice for 
                    this product.

            </li>
            <li>From Paid Hardware Component to Free
                <div>
                    For the initial revenue model for our product, we figured 
                    we would charge the user a one-time fee for the harware componenets
                    (RPi, Barcode Scanner, etc.) as this would on paper generate 
                    more revenue for us. However, a TA (unsure of which one, sorry) 
                    suggested to have the hardware be free, as it would decrease the 
                    barrier of entry for our product, which we decided is the better 
                    option as the product is already such a seemingly luxiorious conveniency
                    and people may be discouraged from adopting our product if there is some
                    upfront cost. We decided to alter our revenue model to be more heavy on the
                    per-order fees and subscription models as opposed to a general one-time charge
                    for the hardware.

                    <h2>The Value Capture Pivot</h2>
                    The value capture pivot can be applied here as we changed our monetization 
                    strategy and revenue model based on a "customer's" insight, the customer
                    being a TA, however, they likely are analyzing the product much like a 
                    potential customer would.
