    <h2>How it Works</h2>

    <div>
      We will acheive this through the use of a web app which the residenses will have accounts on. The user will 
      attch their credit card, preferred delivery schedule, and preferred pickup grocery store. When the user throws
      away an item they wish to reorder, they will scan the item's barcode on a barcode scanner near the trash receptical.
      The barcode scanner will be connected to a Raspberry Pi which can interface with the server, which will add the item
      corresponding to the barcode to the user's cart. When the user's prescheduled order schedule triggers, the server will
      order all of the items in the cart at the time for delivery or pickup.
